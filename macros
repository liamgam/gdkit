These are some macros you should know about.

GDIncludeInterfaceBuilderTemplateDrawing - When building the interface builder additions for gdkit-mac,
this macro turns on any template drawing that's done in interface builder. Template drawing is where
the default object doesn't contain enough information to draw anything, but something needs to be drawn.
So it uses a template - see GDScale9View for an example.
