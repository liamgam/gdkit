# Warning Macros

GDKIT_WARN_1060_ONLY - There are some features in GDKit that require 10.6 or
lower SDK. If you need to compile for 10.5 you can turn on this macro to see
warnings about which classes or features aren't supported. Otherwise Gestalt
checks are in place at runtime.

# Other Macros

GDKIT_PRINT_DEALLOCS - This will turn on a print message like "dealloc [Class]"
for every object that's deallocated in gdkit.

GDKIT_METHOD_CALLS - This will turn on print statements so you can follow the
flor of method calls.
